# find samples with more than 50% genotyped data and use them with mainland samples to build an alignment

##### find good samples:
#get samples with more than 50 genotyping rate : results 18 samples with average rate: ~72%

# options:

# large: uses a temporary directory to reduce RAM use
# thread 6: number of cores to use
# quiet: don't print log to the screen
# ep & op: default gap extension and open penalties for when we don't want large gaps
# retree & maxiterate: options for alignment improvement - balance between accuracy and speed
# add: by adding the samples to the reference we use the reference as a skeleton on which to align the samples; increases accuracy
